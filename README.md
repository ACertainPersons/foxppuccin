# foxppuccin

An **unfinished** Firefox skin based on the Catppuccin Mocha Green theme

(Yes I am aware that <a href="https://github.com/catppuccin/firefox">catppuccon/firefox</a> exists. But that's just a colour theme whereas this is a whole mod)

Only works on MacOS currently

Will be ported to other OSes soon
